-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you find a bug, and want me to fix it, you will need to do a few things for 
me.
	* Give me a copy or part of the code which demonstrates this bug. If
	you can't do this, then replicate the bug in a piece of test code
	and send me that.
	* Make sure you can replicate the bug. Then send me the of instructions
	on how to replicate the noted bug.

If you do this, I will mail you back telling you if the information was
sufficient or not. If it is, I will tell you when I hope to have this bug
licked by. If you need an urgent update (i.e., your boss is crawling down your
throat for your program to work) tell me, I'll get to it ASAP. 

If you find a bug and fixed it yourself, I will need the same as above with a
few extras.
	* I will need a patch of any piece of code you made so I can apply it
	to what I have.
	* Tar this up and send it to me.

If you have found and fixed a valid bug, you will be noted in the next
distribution of this bugs file, and my warmest thanks for reducing my ever
growing workload. :)

Here is the noted list of outstanding bugs and bugs of the past...

4.8.2	Entry		Irrational behavior when the entry field is	Jan/97
			shorter than the text which occupies it.
			Bug found and fixed by 
			Guy Finney <gaf@primenet.com>
4.8.2	All Widgets	Didn't check if the shadow window was NULL	Jan/97
			or not when performing operations on the
			WINDOW pointer.
4.8.2	All Widgets	Registration/unregistration of widgets did	Jan/97
			not work correctly. Caused SEGV when alot
			were killed and a refresh was called.
			Did not adjust the screenIndex value of
			the widget if a widget before it was killed.

			destroyed.

			problems found.
4.8.2	All Widgets	Found a problem when putting a CDK widget in	Jan/97
			a curses window. When an absolute x/y
			coordinate was provided, the x/y position
			it was assigned was based on the main window
			and not the window it was being attached into.
			This problem only occurs when a window other
			than the one one created via initscr was being
			used.
4.8.2	Template	When setting the value of the template widget,	Mar/97
			the cursor usually got mixed up as to where
			it should be compared to where it has to be.
4.8.2	Swindow		The scrolling window would core out if too many	Mar/97
			lines were added. This was because I never
			checked the maximum lines value supplied
			when the widget was created.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.9.0	Dialog		The separation line on the widget was being	April/97
			drawn too far if the curses breed was not
			ncurses.
4.9.0	Viewer		The separation line on the widget was being	April/97
			drawn too far if the curses breed was not
			ncurses.
4.9.0	Matrix		The boxwidth would not get calculated correctly	April/97
			when a weird mixture of rows/columns and
			spacing was used.
4.9.0	Swindow		Centered text did not scroll correctly.		May/97
4.9.0	Fselect		Fixed cut and paste typo in the 		May/97
			setCDKFselectXXXAttribute functions. Thanks
			to andrze@tor.supercomputing.com for
			pointing this out.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.9.1	Scroll		Fixed the scrollbar height. The bar was always	July/97
			being made to the height of the list and not
			the height of the window.
4.9.1	Selection	Fixed the scrollbar height. The bar was always	July/97
			being made to the height of the list and not
			the height of the window.
4.9.1	Radio		Fixed the scrollbar height. The bar was always	July/97
			being made to the height of the list and not
			the height of the window.
4.9.1	All		When a signal was set the signal would return	July/97
			and end up in the character binding routines
			and pass in a bogus value for the key. This would
			cause the index to be set to some wild value and
			cause a bus error.
4.9.1	Scroll		When drawing the scroll bar, I never checked if	July/97
			the scroll bar window was NULL.
4.9.1	Selection	When drawing the scroll bar, I never checked if	July/97
			the scroll bar window was NULL.
4.9.1	Radio		When drawing the scroll bar, I never checked if	July/97
			the scroll bar window was NULL.
4.9.1	Label		Added the functions activateCDKLabel for the	July/97
			builder. The function calls drawCDKLabel
4.9.1	Graph		Added the functions activateCDKGraph for the	July/97
			builder. The function calls drawCDKGraph
4.9.1	Graph		Modified the draw function, so if setCDKGraph	July/97
			has not been called, it doesn't core dump.
4.9.1	Alphalist	When the user hit tab after entering a simple	July/97
			string in the entry field, the widget would
			core out because I didn't check for an upper
			bound on the array inside the while loop.
4.9.1	Slider		When the user asked for a full width slider by	July/97
			passing in FULL or 0, it cored out.
4.9.1	All		Found a major bug in alignxy (which all		Sept/97
			widgets called). This affected a widgets
			alignment when a widget was created in a
			window that was not the full screen.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.9.2	Template	Fixed a small bug in which internal variables	Jan/98
			of the template widget were reading past their
			array bounds. (Array Bounds Read with purify)
			Possible source of SEGV or core dumps.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.9.3	Button Box	Fixed an oversight with the buttonbox key	Apr/98
			key bindings. Bug and patch fix/found by 
			Mark Buckaway <mark@datasoft.on.ca>.
			(thanks :) )
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.9.4			Complete mystery as to what happened these 	April
			months. Must have been kidnapped by aliens.	  to
			Several individuals did send in patches to	 July
			make this 8-bit clean. If the sysadmin at	  of
			the office didn't nuke everyones mailbox, I	 1998
			could give them credit. If you know who you
			are, please mail me, I'll give you credit.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.9.5	Template	The Pre-Process function would never get	July/98
			called becuase of cut-and-paste problems
			during development.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.9.6	None reported. Yeaahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Whoo hooooo!!!!
4.9.7
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.9.8	Entry field.	Incorrect return code. Found by both  		July/99
			Daniel Novy (dnovy@rbeep.com.br) and
			Jorgen Granstam (Jorgen.Granstam@abc.se)
