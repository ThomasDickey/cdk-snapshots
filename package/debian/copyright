There are two cases:

    a) Some were originally authored by Mike Glover, and revised by Thomas E. 
       Dickey.  Mike Glover's changes stopped in 1999.
    b) others are solely the work of Thomas E. Dickey, starting in 1999.

Here is an sample copyright for the first case (permissions for the latter
are identical, though the copyright owner differs of course):

    FSF changes to this file are in the public domain.

    Calling this script install-sh is preferred over install.sh, to prevent
    `make' implicit rules from creating a file called install from it
    when there is no Makefile.

    This script is compatible with the BSD install script, but was written
    from scratch.  It can only install one file at a time, a restriction
    shared with many OS's install programs.
