.SH NAME
Cdk - \fBCurses Development Kit\fR Display Capabilities.
.LP
.SH SYNOPSIS
Cdk has a number of pre-defined display types.
The following are outlined in this manual page:
.It "\(bu How To Use Colors" 5
.It "\(bu How To Use Different Character Attributes" 5
.It "\(bu How To Justify Strings" 5
.It "\(bu How To Use Special Drawing Characters" 5
.It "\(bu Edit/Display Type Codes (EDisplayType)" 5
.SH DESCRIPTION
Cdk has special formatting commands which can be included in any string which
add highlights, justification, or even colors to a basic string.
This manual
page outlines and demonstrates how they work.
.SS How To Use Colors
Cdk has the capability to display colors in almost every string type displayed
in a Cdk widget.
To turn on colors, the function \fIinitCDKColor\fR has to be called.
When this function is called 64 color pairs are created.
Normally the
color pairs are accessed via the COLOR_PAIR macro.
You can still do this, but
creating a string with multiple colors gets terribly difficult.
That is why
the color commands were created.
The color setting are stored directly in the
string and when the widget is created or activated, the string is converted
to take advantage of any color commands in the string.
To turn on a color pair
insert </XX> into the string; where \fIXX\fR is a numeric value from 0 to 64.
Color pair 0 is the standard default color pair for the screen.
To turn off a
color pair use the format command <!XX> where \fIXX\fR is a numeric value from
0 to 64.
The following code segment demonstrates the use of the color commands.

   char		*mesg[4];

   /* Initialize the Cdk screen.	*/
   screen = initscr();
   cdkscreen = initCDKScreen (screen);

   /* Set the labels up.		*/
   mesg[0] = "</1>This line should have a yellow foreground and a blue background.<!1>";
   mesg[1] = "</2>This line should have a white  foreground and a blue background.<!2>";
   mesg[2] = "</3>This line should have a yellow foreground and a red  background.<!3>";
   mesg[3] = "<C>This line should be set to whatever the screen default is.";

   /* Declare the labels.	*/
   demo	= newCDKLabel (cdkscreen, CENTER, CENTER, mesg, 4, TRUE, TRUE);

   /* Draw the label		*/
   drawCDKLabel (demo, TRUE);
   waitCDKLabel (demo, ' ');

   /* Clean up			*/
   destroyCDKLabel (demo);
   destroyCDKScreen (cdkscreen);
   endCDK();
   exit (0);
}

This example uses the color pair 5 (which is white on blue) for the label to
the entry widget.
.PP
.SS How To Use Different Character Attributes
Cdk also provides attribute commands which allow different character attributes
to be displayed in a Cdk widget.
To use a character attribute the format command
is </X> where \fIX\fR is one of several command characters.
To turn a attribute
off use the command <!X>.
The following table outlines the command characters
and what they mean.

   mesg[0] = "</B/1>This line should have a yellow foreground and a blue background.<!1>";
   mesg[1] = "</U/2>This line should have a white  foreground and a blue background.<!2>";
   mesg[2] = "</K/3>This line should have a yellow foreground and a red  background.<!3>";
   mesg[3] = "<C>This line should be set to whatever the screen default is.";

   /* Declare the labels.	*/
   demo	= newCDKLabel (cdkscreen, CENTER, CENTER, mesg, 4, TRUE, TRUE);

   /* Draw the label		*/
   drawCDKLabel (demo, TRUE);
   waitCDKLabel (demo, ' ');

   /* Clean up			*/
   destroyCDKLabel (demo);
   destroyCDKScreen (cdkscreen);

Notice that color commands and format commands can be mixed inside the same
format marker.
The above example underlines the label marker, which also sets
color pair number 5.
.SS How To Justify Strings
Justification commands can left justify, right justify, or center a string of text.
To use a justification format in a string the command <X> is used.
The following table lists all of the format commands available.

\fBCommand/Action.\fR
=
<L>/Left Justified. Default if not stated.
<C>/Centered text.
<R>/Right justified.
<I=X>/Indent the line X characters.
<B=X>/Bullet. X is the bullet string to use.
<F=X>/T{
Links in a file where X is the filename.
Currently only works with the viewer widget.

in a Cdk widget.

   /* Initialize the Cdk screen.	*/

   mesg[0] = "<R></B/1>This line should have a yellow foreground and a blue background.<!1>";
   mesg[1] = "</U/2>This line should have a white  foreground and a blue background.<!2>";
   mesg[2] = "<B=+>This is a bullet.";
   mesg[3] = "<I=10>This is indented 10 characters.";
   mesg[4] = "<C>This line should be set to whatever the screen default is.";

   /* Declare the labels.	*/
   demo	= newCDKLabel (cdkscreen, CENTER, CENTER, mesg, 5, TRUE, TRUE);

   /* Draw the label		*/
   drawCDKLabel (demo, TRUE);
   waitCDKLabel (demo, ' ');

   /* Clean up			*/
   destroyCDKLabel (demo);
   destroyCDKScreen (cdkscreen);
   endCDK();
   exit (0);

The bullet format command can take either a single character or a string.
The bullet in the above example would look like
.RS 3
\fI+\fR This is a bullet.
.RE
but if we were to use the following command instead
.RS 3
<B=***>This is a bullet.
.RE
it would look like
.RS 3
\fI***\fR This is a bullet.
.RE
.PP
The only restriction that a format command has is that it must be at the
beginning of the string.
.SS How To Use Special Drawing Characters
Cdk has a set of special drawing characters which can be inserted into any
ASCII file.
In order to use a special character the format command <#XXX>
is used.
The following table lists all of the special character commands available.

<#HL>/Horizontal Line
<#VL>/Vertical Line
<#PL>/Plus Sign
<#PM>/Plus or Minus Sign
<#DG>/Degree Sign
<#CB>/Checker Board
<#DI>/Diamond
<#BU>/Bullet

The character formats can be repeated using an optional numeric repeat value.
To repeat a character add (XXX) to the end of the character format.
The following example, draws 10 horizontal lines.

<#HL(10)>

The following code segment draws a box within a label window.
