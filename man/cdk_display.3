.SH NAME
cdk_display \-
\fICdk\fP display capabilities
.SH SYNOPSIS
Cdk has a number of pre-defined display types.
The following are outlined in this manual page:
.It "\(bu How To Use Colors" 5
.It "\(bu How To Use Different Character Attributes" 5
.It "\(bu How To Justify Strings" 5
.It "\(bu How To Use Special Drawing Characters" 5
.It "\(bu Edit/Display Type Codes (EDisplayType)" 5
.SH DESCRIPTION
Cdk has special formatting commands which can be included in any string which
add highlights, justification, or even colors to a basic string.
These attributes, once set, remain in effect until changed explicitly,
or until the end of the string.
.LP
This manual
page outlines and demonstrates how they work.
.
.SS "How To Use Colors"
Cdk has the capability to display colors in almost every string type displayed
in a Cdk widget.
.PP
Normally the color pairs are accessed via the COLOR_PAIR macro.
You can still do this, but creating a string with multiple colors is tedious.
That is why the color commands were created.
Use \fBinitCDKColor\fR to create up to 64 color pairs
which you can refer to by number in strings.
.LP
The color settings are stored directly in the string.
When the widget is created or activated, the string is converted
to take advantage of any color commands in the string.
.bP
To turn on a color pair
insert \fI</XX>\fP into the string;
where \fIXX\fR is a numeric value from 0 to the maximum color pair.
.IP
Color pair 0 is the standard default color pair for the screen.
.IP
If you used \fBinitCDKColor\fP, the maximum value for \fIXX\fR is 63
for terminals supporting 8 ANSI colors.
.IP
If you created color pairs directly using \fBinit_pair\fP,
the maximum value for \fIXX\fR is implementation-dependent,
e.g., 63 (for Unix systems) and 255 for ncurses.
.IP
If the terminal does not support color, Cdk uses the \fBbold\fP attribute.
.bP
To turn off a
color pair use the format command <!XX> where \fIXX\fR is a numeric value from
0 to the maximum color pair.
.LP
The following example demonstrates the use of the color commands.

   destroyCDKLabel (demo);
   destroyCDKScreen (cdkscreen);
   endCDK();
   exit (0);
}

.SS "How To Use Different Character Attributes"
Cdk also provides attribute commands which allow different character attributes
to be displayed in a Cdk widget.
To use a character attribute the format command
is \fI</X>\fR where \fIX\fR is one of several command characters.
To turn a attribute off use the command \fI<!X>\fR.
The following table outlines the command characters:

   /* Start CDK Colors */
   initCDKColor();

   /* Set the labels up.  */
   mesg[0] = "</B/31>Bold text            yellow foreground / blue background.<!31>";
   mesg[1] = "</U/05>Underlined text      white  foreground / blue background.<!05>";
   mesg[2] = "</K/26>Blinking text        yellow foreground / red  background.<!26>";
   mesg[3] = "<C>This line uses the screen default colors.";

   /* Declare the labels.  */
   demo = newCDKLabel (cdkscreen, CENTER, CENTER, mesg, 4, TRUE, TRUE);

   /* Draw the label */
   drawCDKLabel (demo, TRUE);
   waitCDKLabel (demo, ' ');

   /* Clean up */
   destroyCDKLabel (demo);
   destroyCDKScreen (cdkscreen);
   endCDK();
   exit (0);

.LP
Note that color commands and format commands can be mixed inside the same
format marker.
The above example underlines the label marker, which also sets
color pair number 2.
.
.SS "How To Justify Strings"
Justification commands can
left justify,
right justify,
or center a string of text.
To use a justification format in a string the command <X> is used.
The following table lists the format commands:
.LP
.TS
center tab(/) box;
l l
l l
lw15 lw35 .
\fBCommand/Action.\fR
=
<L>/Left Justified. Default if not stated.
<C>/Centered text.
<R>/Right justified.
<I=X>/Indent the line X characters.
<B=X>/Bullet. X is the bullet string to use.
<F=X>/T{
Links in a file where X is the filename.
This works only with the viewer widget.
T}

The following example demonstrates how to use the justification commands
in a Cdk widget.

   CDKLABEL     *demo;

   cdkscreen = initCDKScreen (NULL);

   /* Start CDK Colors */
   initCDKColor();

   /* Set the labels up.  */
   mesg[0] = "<R></B/31>This line should have a yellow foreground and a blue background.<!31>";
   mesg[1] = "</U/05>This line should have a white  foreground and a blue background.<!05>";
   mesg[2] = "<B=+>This is a bullet.";
   mesg[3] = "<I=10>This is indented 10 characters.";
   mesg[4] = "<C>This line should be set to whatever the screen default is.";

   /* Declare the labels.  */
   demo = newCDKLabel (cdkscreen, CENTER, CENTER, mesg, 5, TRUE, TRUE);

   /* Draw the label */
   drawCDKLabel (demo, TRUE);
   waitCDKLabel (demo, ' ');

   /* Clean up */
   destroyCDKLabel (demo);
   destroyCDKScreen (cdkscreen);
   endCDK();
   exit (0);
}
.fi

\fI----------------------------------------\fR
.PP
The bullet format command can take either a single character or a string.
The bullet in the above example would look like
.RS 3
\fI+\fR This is a bullet.
.RE
but if we were to use the following command instead
.RS 3
<B=***>This is a bullet.
.RE
it would look like
.RS 3
\fI***\fR This is a bullet.
.RE
.PP
A format command must be at the beginning of the string.
.
.SS "How To Use Special Drawing Characters"
Cdk has a set of special drawing characters which can be inserted into any
ASCII file.
These characters are encoded using the format command \*(``<#\fIXX\fP>\*(''
where \fIXX\fP is a two-character name.
The \fBchar2Chtype\fP and \fBchtype2String\fP functions
provide conversion to/from curses \fBchtype\fP data (see \fBcdk_util\fP(3)).
.PP
The following table lists the supported special character commands.
.TS

<#PL>/Plus Sign
<#PM>/Plus or Minus Sign
<#DG>/Degree Sign
<#CB>/Checker Board

<#S9>/Scan line 9

<#LA>/Left Arrow
<#RA>/Right Arrow
<#TA>/Top Arrow
<#BA>/Bottom Arrow
.TE
.LP
The character formats can be repeated using an optional numeric repeat value.
To repeat a character add the repeat count within parentheses
to the end of the character format.
The following example draws 10 horizontal-line characters:
.LP
<#HL(10)>
.LP
The following example draws a box within a label window:
