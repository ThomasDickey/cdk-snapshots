General
-------
This document details how to build and install the Cdk library. The first thing
you should know is what compile options you may require. I have had the 
fortunate luck of being able to compile this library on the following
platforms:
	* Sun/OS 4.1.*
	* Solaris 2.3/2.4/2.5/2.5.1/2.6
	* AIX 3.2.* (and even AIX 4.1 but there is no mention of this in the
                    makefile. Sorry.)
	* HPUX 9.* (and even HPUX 10.* but there is no mention of this in the
                    makefile. Sorry.)
	* Linux (all sorts Slakware, BSD, and Redhat)

Building
--------
To build the library cd into the Cdk distribution directory and follow 
the following steps:

1) Run configure. This will create a Makefile with a default 
	install directory root of /usr/local. If you want to 
	change the default install directory use the --prefix 
	command line argument on configure. For example, if you
	want to install under /export/local instead, run the command:
	./confugure --prefix="/export/local"

2) Type make. This will make the library, the example binaries
	and the demonstration binaries.

3) Type make install. This will install the CDK distribution. Look
	at step 1 if you want to install other than /usr/local.

4) Start to play. :)
